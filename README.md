# Market-Risk-VaR-Model
This project analyzes the market risk of a hypothetical investment portfolio using Value-at-Risk (VaR) methods, including Historical, Parametric, and Monte Carlo simulations. It visualizes potential losses and quantifies downside risk at a 95% confidence level . 
Key features include:

Calculation of 1-day VaR for a portfolio of real stocks (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, GOOG)

Visualization of return distributions with VaR and Conditional VaR (CVaR)

Implementation of stress scenarios and tail risk analysis

Clean, modular Python code using yfinance, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and scipy
